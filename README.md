# Bird-Classifier
A deep learning model using CNN architecture which classifies birds of three different species 
I have developed a deep learning model that classifies birds on the basis of their physical features. I have used different layers of CNN, like the Convolutional 
layers, MaxPooling layers, Dense layers, and Flatten layers The model is currently limited to three classes of birds, namely the 'Abbots Babbler' and the 'Absynian 
Ground Hornbill' and 'Bald Eagle' 
The model correctly predicts bird images more than 95% of the time. I am still left to add the functionality of detecting an object, animal or bird that doesn't
belong to the three classes classified as being 'invalid' . I will be updating the model as we make some developments.
